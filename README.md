🛒 Customer Sales Behavior Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer sales behavior to understand how customers purchase products, how discounts and subscriptions affect spending, and which products perform best.
The complete project is built using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

I followed an end-to-end data analysis approach:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing → Python

Business Question Analysis → SQL

Visualization & Insights → Power BI Dashboard

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level transaction data with the following columns:

customer_id

age

gender

item_purchased

category

purchase_amount

location

size

color

season

review_rating

subscription_status

shipping_type

discount_applied

promo_code_used

previous_purchases

payment_method

frequency_of_purchases

age_group

purchase_frequency_day

🎯 Business Questions Answered

This project answers real-world business questions such as:

Total revenue generated by male vs female customers

Customers who used discounts but still spent above average

Top 5 products with the highest average review ratings

Average purchase amount comparison between Standard vs Express shipping

Spending comparison between subscribed and non-subscribed customers

Products with the highest discount usage percentage

Customer segmentation into New, Returning, and Loyal

Top 3 most purchased products within each category

Relationship between repeat buyers and subscription status

Revenue contribution by different customer groups

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)

Performed using Python (Pandas & NumPy):

Handled missing values

Removed duplicates

Created derived columns like:

age_group

purchase_frequency_day

Converted data types

Outlier checks on purchase_amount

🧠 SQL Analysis

All business questions were solved using SQL queries, including:

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Filtering with WHERE

Grouping with GROUP BY

Subqueries and conditional logic

Customer segmentation logic

SQL helped validate insights generated from Python analysis.

📊 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created in Power BI to visualize:

Revenue by gender and subscription status

Product performance

Discount impact

Customer segmentation

Purchase behavior trends

The dashboard enables quick business decision-making through visuals.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)

Power BI

Excel

GitHub

📈 Key Insights

Subscribed customers contribute higher average spending

Discounted purchases can still generate above-average revenue

Loyal customers drive a major portion of total revenue

Express shipping customers tend to spend more

High-rated products are not always the most purchased

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates:

Strong data cleaning skills

Ability to solve real-world business problems

Practical use of Python, SQL, and Power BI

End-to-end data analytics workflow
