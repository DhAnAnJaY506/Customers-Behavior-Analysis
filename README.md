# Customer Sales Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer sales behavior to understand how customers purchase products, how discounts and subscriptions affect spending, and which products perform best.
The complete project is built using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

* I followed an end-to-end data analysis approach:
* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing → Python
* Business Question Analysis → SQL
* Visualization & Insights → Power BI Dashboard

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level transaction data with the following columns:
  * customer_id
  * age
  * gender
  * item_purchased
  * category
  * purchase_amount
  * location
  * size
  * color
  * season
  * review_rating
  * subscription_status
  * shipping_type
  * discount_applied
  * promo_code_used
  * previous_purchases
  * payment_method
  * frequency_of_purchases
  * age_group
  * purchase_frequency_day

## Business Questions Answered

1. This project answers real-world business questions such as:
2. Total revenue generated by male vs female customers
3. Customers who used discounts but still spent above average
4. Top 5 products with the highest average review ratings
5. Average purchase amount comparison between Standard vs Express shipping
6. Spending comparison between subscribed and non-subscribed customers
7. Products with the highest discount usage percentage
8. Customer segmentation into New, Returning, and Loyal
9. Top 3 most purchased products within each category
10. Relationship between repeat buyers and subscription status
11. Revenue contribution by different customer groups

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)

### Performed using Python (Pandas & NumPy):

* Handled missing values
* Created derived columns like:
* age_group
* purchase_frequency_day

### SQL Analysis

All business questions were solved using SQL queries, including:
* Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
* Filtering with WHERE
* Grouping with GROUP BY
* Subqueries and conditional logic
* Customer segmentation logic
* SQL helped validate insights generated from Python analysis.

### Power BI Dashboard

* An interactive dashboard was created in Power BI to visualize:
* Revenue by gender and subscription status
* Product performance
* Discount impact
* Customer segmentation
* Purchase behavior trends
* The dashboard enables quick business decision-making through visuals.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
* Power BI
* Excel

## Key Insights

* Subscribed customers contribute higher average spending
* Discounted purchases can still generate above-average revenue
* Loyal customers drive a major portion of total revenue
* Express shipping customers tend to spend more
* High-rated products are not always the most purchased

## Conclusion

* This project demonstrates:
* Strong data cleaning skills
* Ability to solve real-world business problems
* Practical use of Python, SQL, and Power BI
* End-to-end data analytics workflow
